Infrastructure Deployment Pipeline README
Overview

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline designed for Terraform-based infrastructure management. The pipeline is structured into three stages: initialization, planning, and application of Terraform configurations, facilitating an automated and consistent approach to infrastructure deployment.

Pipeline Stages
1. TerraformInit
Purpose: Prepares the Terraform working directory for other commands. This is the initial step where Terraform downloads and installs any necessary providers and modules.

Job: TerraformInitJob
Key Actions:
Executes terraform init.
Ensures that Terraform configurations are correctly initialized before proceeding to planning.

2. TerraformPlan
Purpose: Generates an execution plan for Terraform. This stage shows what Terraform intends to do before making any changes to the infrastructure, allowing for manual review and adjustments.

Job: TerraformPlanJob
Key Actions:
Executes terraform plan -out=tfplan, which saves the plan to a file named tfplan for use in the apply stage.

3. TerraformApply
Purpose: Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a Terraform plan execution plan.

Job: TerraformApplyJob
Key Actions:
Executes terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan, which applies the changes described in tfplan without interactive approval.
